      --------------------------------------------------
      
      matter is organized into:
      
      
         L -- "lepton"
         U -- "up-quark" 
         D -- "down-quark" 
         
      at scales < -18   --  1 attometer == 1 "billionth of a billionth of a meter" == 10^-18 m
      Either we are "near" a single L, U, or D point, or not.
   
      If we are "near" an L, U, or D point, 
         we can get arbitrarily closer to it for all scales < -18.

      --------------------------------------------------
      
      All U's and D's are arranged into triads:
       
          2 U's and a D  -- "proton"     .8 femtometers == .8 "millionth of a billionth of a meter" == .8 * 10^-15 m
          2 D's and a U  -- "neutron"
          
      These are around scale -15.   
      A "scale-15" cube is 1000 "scale-18" cubes to a side
